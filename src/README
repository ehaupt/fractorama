Compiling
---------

   I build with:

      unix: g++ 3.2.2
      win : vc++ 6

   I use Gnu Make to build on both platforms (so you'll need it
   if you want to build this program).

   I've build most recently with qt 3.1.2 on both windows/linux

   You should not have to change the Makefile at all, but you will
   likely need to edit 'directories.inc'.  If you are on unix,
   you'll need to set UNIX_QTROOT as in:

      UNIX_QTROOT := /tools/qt-3.1.2

   (under your UNIX_QTROOT, you should find directories:
    bin, include, lib, etc.)

   On windows, you'll need to set WINDOWS_QTROOT and
   WINDOWS_VC_INCLUDE as in:

      WINDOWS_QTROOT     := c:/qt3.1.2
      WINDOWS_VC_INCLUDE := g:/vs/vc98/include

   (just like UNIX_QTROOT, under your WINDOWS_QTROOT you should find
    directories: bin, include, lib, etc.  in your WINDOWS_VC_INCLUDE
    directory, you'll find (for example) stdio.h)

   Once you have edited the contents of directories.inc, type 'make' (to
   build a debug version) or 'make release' to build a release version

Docs/Examples
-------------
   There are html help files in the 'doc' directory where you'll find
a description of the formula file, list of available functions, coloring
techniques, etc.

   Under the examples subdirectory you will find many example fractal formula
files, a number of interesting ideas and techniques are demonstrated.
