   <H2>Complex Attributes</H2>
  <HR>
  <P>
  There are six available attributes for any complex number:
  <P>
   <UL>
    <LI>real
    <LI>imaginary
    <LI>magnitude
    <LI>sum_of_squares
    <LI>degrees
    <LI>radians
   </UL>
  <P>
  Below is a diagram showing the complex number <B>[4, 3]</B>.  The
  attribute values for <B>real, imaginary, magnitude and degrees</B> are
  labeled for that point.
  <P>
  <A NAME="graph1">
  <IMG SRC="graph1.png">
  <P>
  The <B>sum_of_squares</B> attribute is simply the <B>magnitude</B> attribute
  without taking the square root.  For the point <B>[4, 3]</B> shown in
  the diagram the values of <B>magnitude</B> and <B>sum_of_squares</B> are
  as follows:
  <P>
  <TABLE BORDER=1>
   <TR>
    <TH>attribute</TH>
    <TH>formula</TH>
    <TH>value</TH>
   </TR>

   <TR>
    <TD>magnitude</TD>
    <TD>sqrt(4 * 4 + 3 * 3)</TD>
    <TD>5</TD>
   </TR>

   <TR>
    <TD>sum_of_squares</TD>
    <TD>4 * 4 + 3 * 3</TD>
    <TD>25</TD>
   </TR>
  </TABLE>
  <P>
  The reason for having both <B>sum_of_squares</B> and <B>magnitude</B> is
  that since the <B>magnitude</B> calculation involves taking a square
  root it is slower than the <B>sum_of_squares</B> calculation.  It
  is often possible to create an equivalent (but more quickly generated) fractal
  image by using <B>sum_of_squares</B> instead of <B>magnitude</B>
  <P>
  <A NAME="radians">
  The attribute <B>radians</B> measures the angle a point makes with the
  origin, just like <B>degrees</B>, only the units are different.  A
  good analogy for the relationship between <B>degrees</B> and <B>radians</B>
  would be the relationship between the fahrenheit and celsius temperature
  scales (they both measure the same thing but the results are expressed in
  different units).
  <P>
  The relationship between <B>degrees</B> and <B>radians</B> is based upon
  this equation:
  <P>
  <CODE>
  360 degrees = 6.28 radians
  </CODE>
  <P>
  <A NAME="pi">
  In actuality, 360 degrees does not equal precisely 6.28 radians - it equals
  2 * pi where pi is approximately 3.14159265358979323846.
  <P>
  Here is a diagram showing a number of angles in <B>degrees</B> and their
  equivalent values in <B>radians</B>:
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="piechart.png">
  <P>
  The formulas for converting between degrees and radians are as follows:
  <P>
  <CODE>
  degrees = 57.2958 * radians
  </CODE>
  <P>
  and
  <P>
  <CODE>
  radians = 0.017453 * degrees
  </CODE>
  <P>
  The reason for having both <B>radians</B> and <B>degrees</B> is that
  the trigonometric functions (sin, cos, etc.) all expect the values supplied
  to them to be measured in <B>radians</B>.
  <P>
  Finally, nearly all the attributes have a long and short form
