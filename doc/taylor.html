 <P>
 The taylor series is a mechanism for approximating a function by
 summing polynomial terms.
 <P>
 First, some definitions:
 <P>
 <TABLE BORDER=1>
  <TR>
   <TD>f(x)</TD>
   <TD>the function to approximate</TD>
  </TR>

  <TR>
   <TD>f<sup>n</sup>(x)</TD>
   <TD>the nth derivative of f (note that f<sup>0</sup>(x) = f(x))
  </TR>

  <TR>
   <TD>n!</TD>
   <TD>n factorial, n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 2
  </TR>

 </TABLE>
 <P>
 The taylor series expansion of f(x) around a point (c) is then
 written:
 <PRE>

        n -> infinity
        +----
         \      f<sup>n</sup>(c) * (x - c) <sup>n</sup>
  f(x) = +      -----------------
         /             n!
        +----
        n = 0
 </PRE>
 <P>
 As an example, consider the case where:
 <P>
 <TABLE BORDER=0>
  <TR>
   <TD>f(x)</TD>
   <TD>=></TD>
   <TD>exp(x)</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
   <TD>c</TD>
   <TD>=></TD>
   <TD>0</TD>
  </TR>
 </TABLE>
 <P>
 Since the derivative of exp(x) is exp(x) we know that
 f<sup>n</sup>(x) = exp(x) for all n.
 <P>
 Here are the first few terms of the series:
 <P>
 <TABLE BORDER=1>
  <TR>
   <TH>value of n</TH>
   <TH>term</TH>
   <TH>value of term</TH>
  </TR>
  <TR>
   <TD>0</TD>
   <TD>exp(0) * (x - 0)<sup>0</sup> / 0!</TD>
   <TD>1</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
   <TD>1</TD>
   <TD>exp(0) * (x - 0)<sup>1</sup> / 1!</TD>
   <TD>x</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
   <TD>2</TD>
   <TD>exp(0) * (x - 0)<sup>2</sup> / 2!</TD>
   <TD>x<sup>2</sup> / 2</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
   <TD>3</TD>
   <TD>exp(0) * (x - 0)<sup>3</sup> / 3!</TD>
   <TD>x<sup>3</sup> / 6</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
   <TD>4</TD>
   <TD>exp(0) * (x - 0)<sup>4</sup> / 4!</TD>
   <TD>x<sup>4</sup> / 24</TD>
  </TR>
 </TABLE>
 <P>
 We can write the expansion of exp(x) around c = 0 more concisely
 as follows:
 <P>
 <PRE>
        n -> infinity
        +----
         \      x<sup>n</sup>
  f(x) = +      --
         /      n!
        +----
        n = 0
 </PRE>
 <P>
 Now lets look at how accurate the approximation is as we add more
 terms.  In this case, lets use x = 3.
 <P>

 As you can see, the approximation converges pretty rapidly on the
 actual value of exp(x).
 <P>
 Ok, so how do we apply this to generating a fractal? Firstly, all
 the statements about 'x' above apply equally well to 'z' where z
 is the complex number (x + iy).
 <P>
 In our case, assume 'current' is the point 'z' for which we wish to
 create an approximation of exp(z).  Our algorithm (in pseudo code)
 looks like this:
 <P>
 <pre>
 set actualValue   = exp(current)
 set maxIterations = 20
 set tolerance     = .00001
 set count         = 0
 set zSum          = [0, 0]
 set denominator   = 1

 while count is less than maxIterations and
       the magnitude of the difference between actualValue and zSum is
       greater than tolerance
 do
    zSum  = zSum + current<sup>count</sup> / denominator

    if count is greater than 0
       denominator = denominator * (count + 1)
    endif

    count = count + 1
 done
 </pre>
 <P>
 In this example, our expansion point (c) is zero, we can readily
 generalize our algorithm to handle other values of (c)
 <P>
 <pre>
 set actualValue   = exp(current)
 set maxIterations = 20
 set tolerance     = .00001
 set count         = 0
 set zSum          = [0, 0]
 set denominator   = 1
 set c             = [2, 3]
 set cValue        = exp(c)

 while count is less than maxIterations and
       the magnitude of the difference between actualValue and zSum is
       greater than tolerance
 do
    zSum  = zSum + cValue * (current - c)<sup>count</sup> / denominator

    if count is greater than 0
       denominator = denominator * (count + 1)
    endif

    count = count + 1
 done

 Finally, here is a full-on fractorama formula file demonstrating this
 technique
