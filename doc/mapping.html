   <H2>Mapping Section</H2>
  <HR>
  <P>
  The mapping section establishes two things:
  <P>
  <UL>
   <LI>The region of the complex plane in which we are interested
   <LI>The size of the image (in pixels) into which our complex region
       will be mapped
  </UL>
  <P>
  The general form of the <B>mapping</B> section is as follows:
  <P>
   <PRE>
      mapping
      {
         ( real_start, imaginary_start, real_end, imaginary_end ) =>
         ( x_pixels, y_pixels )
      }
   </PRE>
  <P>
  Here is a typical example and a diagram that graphically shows the meaning
  of the mapping:
  <P>
   <PRE>
      mapping
      {
         (-2, -2, 2, 2) => (640, 480)
      }
   </PRE>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="graph2.png">
  <P>
  Some points worth noting in the above example:
  <P>
  <UL>
   <LI>The region we are mapping from is square (-2, -2, 2, 2) but the
       size we are mapping to (640, 480) is not.  We could have just as
       easily mapped to a square region (400 x 400 pixels for example) but
       this example demonstrates that the dimensions of our region and
       our pixel sizes do not have to be the same proportions.
   <P>
   <LI>Our region is ordered in the form:
   <P>
    <OL>
     <LI>low real value (-2)
     <LI>low imaginary value (-2)
     <LI>high real value (2)
     <LI>high imaginary value (2)
    </OL>
   <P>
   But this is not a requirement.  You can reverse your image horizontally
   by swapping the first and third (real) values, you can invert your image
   vertically by swapping the second and fourth (imaginary) values.
  </UL>
  <P>
  Another useful feature is the ability to specify values using mathematical
  expressions, rather than just numbers.  As an example, suppose you have
  created an image whose mapping section looks like this:
  <P>
  <PRE>
   mapping
   {
      (-0.41386029741100522000,
       -1.42541871282411380000,
       1.98659894437602790000,
       1.41319953487773910000) => (417, 346)
   }
  </PRE>
  <P>
  If you decided you wanted to create a larger version of the image (the
  size in pixels, not the selected region) you can double its width and
  height by doing:
  <P>
  <PRE>
   mapping
   {
      (-0.41386029741100522000,
       -1.42541871282411380000,
       1.98659894437602790000,
       1.41319953487773910000) => (417 * 2, 346 * 2)
   }
  </PRE>
  <P>
  In practice, this is a very useful feature.  You can use any expression
  you like that involves:
  <P>
  <UL>
   <LI>numbers
   <LI>operators: +, -, *, /
   <LI>parentheses
  </UL>
  <P>
  The only restrictions are that the sizes in pixels must work out to be
  a number > 0 for both width and height.  Here is an example demonstrating
  the use of more complicated expressions:
  <P>
  <PRE>
   mapping
   {
      (2 - 4, 3 - 5, (.25 + .25) * 4, 6 / 3) =>
      ((1 + 2 + 3 + 4) * 64, 2 * 2 * 120)
   }
  </PRE>
  <P>
  Of course the above example just works out to be our original example
  (after evaluating the expressions)
  <P>
   <PRE>
      mapping
      {
         (-2, -2, 2, 2) => (640, 480)
      }
   </PRE>
  <P>
  But it does demonstrate the range of possibilities available for
specifying the region and pixel values.
