   <H2>Fractal Formula File</H2>
  <HR>
  <P>
  The fractal formula file has a structure like this:
  <P>
  <PRE>
   fractal
   {
      <A HREF="mapping.html">mapping</A> {
         ...
      }

      <A HREF="colors.html">colors</A> {
         ...
      }

      <A HREF="formula.html">formula</A> {
         ...
      }
   }
   </PRE>
   <P>
   The details of each section can be found by following the appropriate link,
this document will focus on the high-level characteristics of the formula
file.
   <P>
   Here are some overall notes:
   <P>
   <UL>
    <LI>The formula file must begin with the <B>fractal</B> keyword which is
        followed by the sections enclosed within '{' and '}'.
      
    <P>
    <LI>All keywords in the fractal formula file are case sensitive.  This
        means that:
        <P>
        <UL>
         <LI>fractal
         <LI><A HREF="mapping.html">mapping</A>
         <LI><A HREF="colors.html">colors</A>
         <LI><A HREF="formula.html">formula</A>
        </UL>
        <P>
        will be recognized but:
        <P>
        <UL>
         <LI>FRACTAL
         <LI>Mapping
         <LI>CoLoRs
         <LI>forMULA
        </UL>
        <P>
        will not be
    <P>
    <LI>The sections must appear in the order shown above, but not all
        the sections are required.  Here is a summary:
    <P>
     <TABLE BORDER=1>
      <TR><TH>Section Name</TH><TH>Required?</TH><TR>
      <TR><TD><A HREF="mapping.html">mapping</A></TD><TD>yes</TD></TR>
      <TR><TD><A HREF="colors.html">colors</A></TD><TD>no</TD></TR>
      <TR><TD><A HREF="formula.html">formula</A></TD><TD>yes</TD></TR>
     </TABLE>
    <P>
    <LI>Whitespace is ignored, you could write your formula file all on
        one single line if you wanted to.
    <P>
    <LI>The formula file allows you to place comments inside the file,
        three styles of comments are supported:
    <P>
     <UL>
      <LI>C style comments, where everything between /* and */ is treated
          as a comment
      <P>
      <LI>C++ style comments, where everything between // and the end of the
          line is treated as a comment
      <P>
      <LI>Script style comments, where everything between # and the end of the
          line is treated as a comment
     </UL>
    <P>
    Here are some examples of the three comment styles
    <P>
<PRE>
     /* -- This is a C style comment,
           note that it can span multiple lines -- */

     // This c++ style comment ends at the end of this line

     # So does this script style comment
