  The purpose of the <B>formula</B> section is to define the fractal equation
that we use to actually create an image.  Before we discuss the format of
the <B>formula</B> section, here is an overview of how fractal images
are generated:
<P>
The <A HREF="mapping.html">mapping</A> section establishes a relationship
between a region in the complex plane and an image size in pixels.  As
an example, consider this mapping:
<P>
<PRE>
   mapping {
      (-2, -2, 2, 2) => (100, 100)
   }
</PRE>
<P>
The resulting image will be 100 pixels by 100 pixels so a total of 10,000
pixels will need to be assigned a color to generate the image.  It is the
job of the <B>formula</B> section to assign those color values.  The
<B>formula</B> section will be executed once for each pixel - a total of
10,000 times for this example.
<P>
A key concept for the <B>formula</B> section is the idea of
"the current point".  In the example above, we'll create an image that is
100 pixels wide and 100 pixels tall - the steps the program goes through
to accomplish this are as follows:
<P>
<OL>
 <LI>Take the starting and ending real values (-2 and 2 for this example)
     and using the number of horizontal pixels, determine the needed step
     value so that the correct number of pixels is generated.  In this case,
     we want the first pixel to correspond the the first value (-2) and that
     last (100th) pixel to correspond the the last value (2).
     <P>
     The formula the program uses to determine the step value is:
     <PRE>
        (end_value - start_value) / (number_of_pixels - 1)
     </PRE>
     <P>
     So for our example we end up with:
     <P>
     <PRE>
        (2 - -2) / (100 - 1) = .0404040404
     </PRE>
     <P>
     The horizontal values (in real coordinates) corresponding to the pixel
     values then would be:
     <P>
     <TABLE BORDER=1>
      <TR><TH>pixel number</TH><TH>real coordinate value</TH></TR>
      <TR><TD>0</TD><TD>-2</TD>
      <TR><TD>1</TD><TD>-1.9595</TD>
      <TR><TD>2</TD><TD>-1.9191</TD>
      <TR><TD>3</TD><TD>-1.8787</TD>
      <TR><TD>...</TD><TD>...</TD>
      <TR><TD>96</TD><TD>1.8787</TD>
      <TR><TD>97</TD><TD>1.9191</TD>
      <TR><TD>98</TD><TD>1.9595</TD>
      <TR><TD>99</TD><TD>2</TD>
     </TABLE>
 <P>
 <LI>Take the starting and ending imaginary values (-2 and 2 for this example)
     and perform a similar calculation to determine the appropriate step value
     so that the correct number of vertical pixels is generated.  In this
     case since the imaginary values are the same as the real values and the
     height in pixels is the same as the width in pixels, the step value will
     be: .0404040404 in the imaginary direction, just as it was in the real
     direction.
     <P>
 <LI>Having calculated the two step values, the program then loops through all
     the pixels and gives the <B>formula</B> section a chance to assign the
     color for each pixel.  The logic looks like this:
     <P>
     <PRE>
        for each pixel in the vertical direction
           for each pixel in the horizontal direction
              determine the current point
              execute the formula section to color this pixel
           end horizontal loop
        end vertical loop
     </PRE>
     <P>
     Using the real and imaginary step values, the program calculates the
     current point, loads this value into the predefined variable
     <B>current</B> and then executes the <B>formula</B> section.
 <P>
 <U><H2>Structure of the formula section</H2></U>
<P>
<PRE>
   formula
   {
      zero or more statements

      while(boolean_expression)
      {
         zero or more statements
      }

      zero or more statements
   }
</PRE>
We refer to <B>statements</B> in three places above, more formally the
definition of <A NAME="statements"><B>statements</B></A> is:
<UL>
 <P>
 One or more of the following:
 <P>
 <UL>
  <LI>A color assignment statement
  <LI>A double variable assignment statement
  <LI>A complex variable assignment statement
  <LI>A conditional statement
  <LI>A for statement
  <LI>A print/println statement
  <LI>break or continue statement
 </UL>
</UL>
<P>
A detailed explanation of the various statements can be
found <A HREF="statements.html">here</A>
<P>
<U><H4>while</H4></U>
<P>
The sequence of events that occurs when we are executing the formula section
for a particular pixel is:
<P>
<UL>
 <LI>(as we mentioned before) the current real and imaginary coordinates
     are loaded into the predefined complex variable <B>'current'</B>
 <P>
 <LI>the statements before the while loop are executed
 <P>
 <A NAME="count">
 <LI>Another predefined variable <B>$count</B> is set to zero - then
     we begin executing the following:
     <PRE>
     while boolean_expression is true (non zero)
        execute the statements inside the while loop
        add 1 to the value of <B>$count</B>
     end while
     </PRE>
 <P>
 <LI>once boolean_expression has become false (zero) the statements after
     the while loop are executed
</UL>
<P>
The final point about the formula section concerns color assignment.  Each
time the formula section is executed, whatever value is assigned to the
current pixel (via an indexed or direct color assignment statment) determines
the color that pixel will have in the resulting image.  Though the set_color
statement can occur anywhere, is usually only occurs in the set of statements
that follow the while loop.  The reason is that the statements inside the
while loop get executed many, many times and color assignment typically
needs to be done only once - after the while loop has terminated.
