  <HR>
  <P>
We'll start by generating a simple (but relatively nice looking) image
right away.
  <P>
  <OL>
   <LI>First, create a new Fract-O-Rama window by choosing:
   <P>
   <B>File</B> => <B>New</B>
   <P>
   <LI>Now, using your mouse, highlight the text below starting with
       the line that begins with <B>fractal</B> down to and including
       the last line that begins with <B>}</B>.  If you are on
       windows, press Control-C after highlighting the text to store
       it into your clipboard.
   <P>
   <LI>Now click your mouse in the top half of the new Fract-O-Rama window
       (the area where the cursor is blinking).  If you are on windows
       you'll need to press Control-V to paste the text.
   <P>
   <LI>Now press the 'draw' icon <IMG SRC="drawbutton.png"> - you should
       see the image below

fractal
{
   mapping
   {
      (-2, -2, 2, 2) => (200, 200)
   }

   formula
   {
      z         = [0, 0];
      $maxCount = 20;
      $maxSSQ   = 4;

      while($count &lt; $maxCount)
      {
         $dist = ssq(z);

         if($dist &gt; $maxSSQ)
         {
            break;
         }

         $ratio = $dist / $maxSSQ;
         z      = z ^ 2 + current;
      }

      $r = get_sin_color($ratio, 255, 1);
      $g = get_sin_color($ratio, 205, 1);
      $b = get_sin_color($ratio, 155, 1);

      set_color($r, $g, $b);
   }
}

Now we'll zoom in on an area of the fractal, using your left mouse button
click, drag and release on the image to select an area you'd like to zoom
in on.  Once you have released the mouse the image area will look
something like this
<P>
<IMG SRC="zoomin.png">
<P>
Now click the "Zoom In" button <IMG SRC="zoominbutton.png">
<P>
A new window will open and the zoomed in area will be drawn, it will
look something like this:
<P>
<IMG SRC="start2.png">
<P>
You can close the zoom window if you wish, we're now going to go through
the formula file we used step by step and explain how it works.
<P>
The overall structure of the formula file is described
<A HREF="fractal.html">here</A>, here we'll just work through the
<B>formula</B> section and explain what it does.
<P>
<PRE>
   formula
   {
      z         = [0, 0];
      $maxCount = 20;
      $maxSSQ   = 4;
</PRE>
<P>
Here we initialize some variables.  One complex variable (z) and two
double variables ($maxCount and $maxSSQ).  You can find more information
about variables and assignments <A HREF="statements.html">here</A> but
for now:
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
 <TR>
  <TH>Variable Name</TH>
  <TH>Value</TH>
  <TH>Explanation</TH>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>z</TD>
  <TD>[0, 0]</TD>
  <TD>Initialize 'z' to the origin [0, 0]</TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>$maxCount</TD>
  <TD>20</TD>
  <TD>Tells the maximum number of times the 'while' loop below
      is allowed to execute</TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>$maxSSQ</TD>
  <TD>4</TD>
  <TD>Tells how far 'z' is allowed to get away from the origin before
      we'll stop executing the while loop below</TD>
 </TR>
</TABLE>
<PRE>
      while($count &lt; $maxCount)
      {
         // ...
      }
</PRE>
<P>
This portion says: "Execute all the statements inside the '{' '}' so long
as the condition: ($count &lt; $maxCount) is true".  The variable
<B>$count</B> is an automatic variable - the number of times the while
loop has been executed, Fract-O-Rama keeps track of this value for you
and makes sure it always has the correct value.
<P>
Our condition then says: "Do these statements $maxCount
(in our case 20) times"
<PRE>
      {
         $dist = ssq(z);

         if($dist &gt; $maxSSQ)
         {
            break;
         }
</PRE>
In this section, we set the value '$dist' to be ssq(z).  Basically
what we're doing is measuring how far 'z' is from the origin and
storing that distance in '$dist'.  You can find more information about
ssq <A HREF="complex_attributes.html">here</A>
<P>
The next part:
<PRE>
         if($dist &gt; $maxSSQ)
         {
            break;
         }
</PRE>
Says "If the distance between the origin and 'z' is larger than $maxSSQ
(in our case 4) break out of the loop".  Breaking out of the loop means
that no more statements inside the loop will be executed, control
jumps to the next statement after the while loop.
<PRE>
         $ratio = $dist / $maxSSQ;
         z      = z ^ 2 + current;
      }
</PRE>
This last portion of the while loop does two things:
<UL>
 <LI>Assigns the variable '$ratio' to be $dist / $maxSSQ.  Note that
     we know that $dist will be less than or equal to $maxSSQ
     because we got beyond the if test above.  As a result, the
     value stored in $dist will always be between 0 and 1
 <LI>Assign: z = z ^ 2 + current.  This formula is the famous
     mandelbrot set, the first fractal ever discovered.
</UL>
<PRE>
      $r = get_sin_color($ratio, 255, 1);
      $g = get_sin_color($ratio, 205, 1);
      $b = get_sin_color($ratio, 155, 1);

      set_color($r, $g, $b);
   }
</PRE>
Here we set we're ultimately trying to assign a color value.  When
we call 'set_color' we're saying: "This is the color that I want
to use to color the current pixel".  In our case we generate three
color values ($r, $g and $b) and use those values to specify our
pixel color.
<P>
Our $r, $g and $b values are generated by the call to 'get_sin_color'.
The 'get_sin_color" function will return back a value between 0 and
255 that we can use when calling set_color.  For more information
about 'get_sin_color' you may look
<A HREF="coloring_techniques.html">here</A>
<P>
By far the best way to become adept at using this program is to study
and experiment upon some of the (more than 300!) example formula files
provided as part of the Fract-O-Rama distribution.
