  <HR>
  <P>
  The purpose of this document is to explain a number of fractal
coloring options.  In reality the number of available coloring techniques
is infinite but here we'll just go through a representative sample to provide
a basis for futher experimentation.
  <P>
   We'll be using the same formula file throughout this discussion - a
simple mandelbrot fractal.  The portions of the file that will not change
are as follows:
<PRE>
   fractal
   {
      mapping
      {
         (-2, -2, 2, 2) => (200, 200)
      }

      // 'colors' section (if used) will go here

      formula
      {
         z = [0, 0];

         while($count < 100 && ssq(z) < 4)
         {
            z = z * z + current;
         }

         // color assignment will go here
      }
   }
</PRE>
<P>
There are two ways to assign color:
<P>
<UL>
 <LI>indexed color (using a color table)
 <LI>direct color (specify an rgb value)
</UL>
<P>
Here is a minimal example that assigns the color red using an indexed color
model.  This example uses the formula above, its colors section is:
<PRE>
colors
{
   define
   {
      [255 0 0] // this is entry 0
      [0 255 0] // this is entry 1
      [0 0 255] // this is entry 2
   }
}
</PRE>
And it's color assigment is:
<PRE>
set_color(0);
</PRE>
<P>
Note that the value passed to <B>set_color</B> (in this case zero) is what
is used to select a color from the color table.  If we had wanted to
assign a color of blue instead, we would have used:
<PRE>
set_color(2);
</PRE>
<P>
Now here is an equally straightforward example that also assigns the color
red but this time using a direct color approach
<PRE>
// No need for a 'colors' section when using direct color

set_color(255, 0, 0);
</PRE>
<P>
In practice, of course, we wouldn't use the same value each time - this
would result in a pretty uninteresting image (a solid color).  When doing
real color assignment we would compute the index (when doing color-table based
color) or rgb value (when doing direct color).  It is the flexibility
allowed in the computation that allows us to color our fractal images in
so many different ways.
<P>
Now we'll examine some "real world" examples, we'll cover indexed (color
table based) color assignment first.
<P>
<U><H4>coloring techniques - indexed color</H4></U>
<P>
One very important point about using indexed color is this:
<P>
<B>Care must be taken to ensure that the calculation you use to generate
   the appropriate color index falls within the bounds of the color
   table you have created</B>
<P>
While this is important, the program is forgiving - if you supply an index
that is outside the bounds of your color table, that pixel will simply
be colored black and you will see a brief message once your image has
been fully drawn detailing how many invalid indices were encountered while
processing your image.
<P>
Now we'll cover some common techniques:

         <A HREF="complex_attributes.html#graph1">this</A>).  Note that
         our color table defines entries from 0 to 360 so there is a
         corresponding entry for each angle in degrees (we won't generate
         any 'out of bounds' entries)

   <LI>Explanation
   <P>
    <UL>
     <LI>Here we set up two gradients, each covering 360 indices (one per
         degree).  The cyan shades cover (0 - 359) and the green shades
         color (360 - 719)
     <P>
     <LI>We want to use the cyan set half the time and the green set half
         the time so we use <A HREF="formula.html#count">$count</A>
         (the number of iterations of the while loop that were executed
         before the loop terminated) for this purpose.  The statement:
         <PRE>
   if(<A HREF="double_functions.html#fmod">fmod</A>($count, 2) == 0)
         </PRE>
         Says "if count was even", the reason being that if <B>$count</B>
         was an even number then the remainder when dividing it by two will
         be zero.  Note that when <B>$count</B> is odd, we add 360 to the
         z's angle to select the portion of our color table containing the
         green entries.
      <P>
      It is also worth noting that we could have done an equivalent color
      assignment in a number of other ways, such as:
      <P>
      <UL>
       <LI>
       <PRE>
   $value = deg(z);

   if(fmod($count, 2) == 1)
   {
      $value = $value + 360;
   }

   set_color($value);
       </PRE>
       <LI>
       <PRE>
   set_color(fmod($count, 2) * 360 + deg(z));
       </PRE>
      </UL>
      The resulting value passed to <B>set_color</B> is all that matters -
      the manner in which we generate the value is up to us.

     <LI>The color table used here uses two gradients - note that the size
         of each gradient here is 101, not 361 as in the previous examples.
         The reason we used 361 before is because before we were working
         with angles (which range from 0 to 360), in this magnitude based
         example we just chose 100 as that size results in a nice
         looking range of colors.
     <P>
     <LI>The magnitude of a complex number can really be anything - it is
         the distance of the value from the origin (for more details see
         <A HREF="complex_attributes.html#graph1">this</A>) so we need to
         restrict its range to ensure the value we produce isn't outside
         the bounds of our color table.  My doing:
         <PRE>
         <A HREF="double_functions.html#fmod">fmod</A>(mag(z), 5)</A>
         </PRE>
         We get a value between 0 and 5 which we then multiply by 20 to
         produce a value between 0 and 100.  Once we have that value, we
         use <B>$count</B> to alternately choose betwen the first and second
         set of colors.

Certainly some of the above techniques seem complicated, but their purpose
is just to illustrate how many coloring possibilities are available.  The
best way to develop new techniques is just to experiment, there are an
unlimited number of interesting and beautiful coloring approaches
waiting to be explored.
<P>
<U><H4>direct color based techniques</H4></U>
<P>
With direct color assignment, you do not need a <B>colors</B> section
(though it is not an error to have one).  Direct color assignment just
involves generating values for red, green and blue - each between 0 and 255.
<P>
If any of your generated values are less than 0 or greater than 255 the
pixel will be colored black and (much like indexed color assignment) you
will receive a notification when you image has fully drawn indicating
the number of invalid color assignments.
<P>
Also note that direct and indexed color are not mutually exclusive
alternatives - there is no problem with mixing them together within the
same generated image.
<P>
Here is an example using direct color assignment:

      $blue  = 255 - 255 * $value2;

 <LI>Explanation
 <P>
 Consider the first two calculations:
 <PRE>
      $value1 = abs(sin(real(z)));
      $value2 = abs(cos(imag(z)));
 </PRE>
 <P>
 The sin or cos of any number will be a value between -1 and 1.  Taking the
 absolute value gives us a value between 0 and 1 for both $value1 and $value2.
 <P>
 Our goal here is to assign to $red, $green and $blue a value between 0 and
 255.  We might have assigned $red and $blue more simply as:
 <PRE>
      $red   = 255 * $value1;
      $blue  = 255 * $value2;
 </PRE>
 <P>
 But instead we did:
 <PRE>
      $red   = 255 - 255 * $value1;
      $blue  = 255 - 255 * $value1;
 </PRE>
 <P>
 The subtraction from 255 just inverts the color, a full red (255) becomes
 no red (0) and no red (0) becomes full red (255).
 <P>
 Lastly, for $green, we simply use the smaller of $red and $blue
 <P>

      $green = min($red, $blue);
